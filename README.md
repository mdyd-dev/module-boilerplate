# What is this?

This repo is a boilerplate for @platform-os module using yeoman and postinstall hook.

Modules can be created without yeoman, it is just a great tool so you might want to check it out.

Out of the box it gives you:

* templating (lodash)
* conflict resolution
* gathering user input (inquirer.js)

... and many more.
